/*
Function: SHZ_fnc_anyInArea

Description:
    Functions similarly to inAreaArray except that this function
	returns a boolean if any of the given positions are in the area.
	This takes advantage of short-circuiting so it will perform better
	when any position that matches is at the start of the array.
	See also: https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/inAreaArray

Returns:
	Boolean
