                ACE is being used by this mission. Here are some basic tips
                if you are not familiar with ACE:
                &lt;br/&gt;
                - Hold [Ctrl+Windows] to show self-interactions
                  &lt;br/&gt;
                - Hover over an interaction and release to perform it
                  &lt;br/&gt;
                - Hold [Windows] to interact with players and objects
                  &lt;br/&gt;
                - If your weapon jams, you can unjam it by pressing [Shift+R]
                &lt;br/&gt;
                &lt;br/&gt;
                If enabled, your weapon may overheat from firing too frequently.
                Having suppressors attached to your gun will cause it to heat up
                much more quickly. It is recommended to remove your suppressor
                when un-needed, or bring a canteen / water bottle to
                cool down your gun when needed.
                &lt;br/&gt;
                &lt;br/&gt;
                In ACE, stamina management is critical to surviving in combat
                against zombies. If you sprint or move at low ready too often,
                you will quickly burn through your stamina, and running
                completely out of stamina will force you to walk.
                &lt;br/&gt;
                To preserve stamina, lower your gun whenever possible
                by pressing [2xLeftCtrl], and also stand up so you can jog
                with the least effort. Carrying fewer items will also reduce
                the stamina needed to maneuver around.

                There are various vehicle service stations around base.
                Once you are parked beside one, you will need to exit the
                vehicle to service it.
                &lt;br/&gt;
                Refuel:
                Walk to the gas station / fuel container and interact with it
                to grab the fuel pump.
                &lt;br/&gt;
                Rearm:
                Walk to the vehicle rearm container and interact with it
                to rearm your vehicle.
                &lt;br/&gt;
                Repair:
                Grab a toolkit and interact with your vehicle to perform a
                "Full Repair".

                At a rearm station, ACE can be used to replace weapon pylons
                on an existing aircraft:
                &lt;br/&gt;
                1. Grab a toolkit.
                   &lt;br/&gt;
                2. Park the aircraft near a vehicle rearm station.
                   &lt;br/&gt;
                3. Exit the vehicle, interact with it, and select "Configure Pylons".
                   &lt;br/&gt;
                4. Choose the pylons you want and click "OK" to start replacing pylons.
                   &lt;br/&gt;
                5. Once complete, walk to the rearm station and interact with
                   it to load the modified pylons with their corresponding munitions.

                This is an open world mission where you will be completing
                objectives across %1 to fight off the apocalypse.

                Near your spawn should be a whiteboard that shows your statistics
                across game restarts. For server admins, this also allows them
                to perform administrative actions for the mission.

                On the border of the map, you will see the amount of points
                you have measured in BP. This currency persists across
                restarts every time the mission is saved, which may be
                automatic if autosaving is enabled (the default),
                or otherwise manually saved by the server admin.
                &lt;br/&gt;
                &lt;br/&gt;
                You gain points whenever you kill zombies or hostiles, or complete
                missions. As you accumulate points, your points multiplier also
                increases, allowing you to gain points more quickly. This points
                multiplier gets reset whenever you die or return to base.
                External factors can also affect your points multiplier,
                such as whether it is night time.
                &lt;br/&gt;
                &lt;br/&gt;
                Shopkeepers at base can be used to purchase various items
                and services using the points you've earned, including
                vehicles and AI recruits. Kills achieved by recruits
                you've purchased will count towards your kill count
                and point rewards.

                Safezones are marked on map in solid blue, indicating areas
                where zombies will not spawn in. Some missions produce safezones
                upon completion, but may only last for a certain period of time
                before disappearing. Note that safezones do not prevent zombies
                from entering them.

                Zombies and Demons's infection module is enabled, meaning
                that zombie hits have a chance to cause infection. This
                infection will progress until it takes over motor functions,

                infection by taking antivirus medications or by going through
                a decontamination shower.
